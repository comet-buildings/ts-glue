# Glue

TypeScript opiniated dependency injection library. Why another dependency injection library? 
Most dependency injection libraries target object oriented codebases. Glue is a tiny lightweight library made for FP codebases making extensive use of partial application for dependency injection. Main benefits of Glue include:
- TypeScript type level configuration checks: Glue allows to check at buidtime that all dependencies have been registered.
- Lazyness: A function or a component managed by Glue can be used anywhere in your codebase without worrying when and how dependencies will be set up at runtime. 
- Modularity: Glue is monorepo friendly, configuration can be splitted into several modules without losing buildtime checking nor lazyness. 

See below for more detailed explanations and examples.
